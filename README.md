# University of Wisconsin - System Custom JavaScript Modifications

University of Wisconsin â€“ System has implemented custom JavaScript to ensure consistent user experience.

## Course Navigation.

The first time a course is accessed by a teacher or higher the navigation resets to the fixed template.  Users may notice that the navigation has been changed.  Several page refreshes may be required.

The fixed navigation will be ordered as followed; Home, Syllabus, Announcements, Assignments, Grades, Collaborations, Office 365.  The following items are disabled; discussions, people, pages, files, modules, outcomes, and conferences.  If users enable them, they will be turned back off, within a few page refreshes.
